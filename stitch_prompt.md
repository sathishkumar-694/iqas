# Stitch & Figma UI Generation Prompt

Copy and paste the following prompt into your UI generation tool (like Stitch or v0.dev) to get a modern, premium design that you can export to Figma:

> **Prompt:**  
> "Generate a clean, modern, and professional web application interface for an enterprise IT Quality Assurance System (IQAS). The design should look extremely premium.
> 
> **Screen 1: Supreme Admin Login Interface**
> - Create an exclusive login screen with a dark-themed aesthetic or sleek glassmorphism elements. Use deep navy blues, stark whites, and bright red/crimson accents to signify its secure, restricted nature.
> - Include two crisp input fields (Admin Email and Password) and a vibrant, hover-animated 'Secure Login' button. 
> 
> **Screen 2: Main Dashboard & Bug Tracker**
> - Layout: A collapsible sidebar navigation and a top header containing a user profile and a bell icon with a red notification dot.
> - Main Content: A clean grid displaying 'Project Cards' (showing project name, assigned Team Lead, and total open bugs). Below the cards, feature a sleek 'Recent Bugs' data table with status badges (e.g., green for 'Resolved', yellow for 'In Progress', red for 'Open'). 
> - Aesthetics: Use a beautiful, cohesive color palette (no generic primary colors). Use smooth gradients, subtle box shadows on cards, and modern typography like 'Inter' or 'Outfit'. Ensure the interface feels responsive, dynamic, and state-of-the-art."
